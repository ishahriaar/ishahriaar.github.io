Machine learning has already been used in the health sector. Diabetes can also trigger the permanent loss of kidney function. Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is one of the most recurrent diabetic micro vascular issues and has become the dominant cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD).Therefore, there is a need for a machine learning model and application that can effectively predict and track the level of diabetes along with Diabetic kidney disease. In this paper, our key motive is to find an efficient machine learning model to predict diabetes and diabetic kidney disease (DKD). Since, Disease Prognosis is a sensitive issue, it is not ethical to provide a result without extensive testing. Therefore, we have assessed our model using Recall, F-1 Score, Precision, AUC and also followed some robust evaluation metrics such as ROC, Sensitivity and Specificity to appraise performance of the models from the medical perspective. We are able to obtain an optimized prediction models using LightGBM with an accuracy of 98.75% on diabetic kidney disease prediction and CatBoost with accuracy of 96.15% on diabetes prediction. We have also proposed a web application using our prognostic machine learning model to predict the result based on user input. This application can be used to predict the initial stage of the diabetes mellitus and diabetic kidney disease which may help to expedite the existing disease medication process.","tags":[],"title":"Thesis/Publications","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)   Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \n A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/media/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}   Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }   Questions?
